# Puppet::ResourceApi [![TravisCI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/puppetlabs/puppet-resource_api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/puppetlabs/puppet-resource_api) [![Appveyor Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/8o9s1ax0hs8lm5fd/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/puppetlabs/puppet-resource-api/branch/master) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/puppetlabs/puppet-resource_api/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/puppetlabs/puppet-resource_api)

This is an implementation of the [Resource API](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-specifications/blob/master/language/resource-api/README.md) specification. Find a working example of a new-style providers in the [Palo Alto Firewall module](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-panos/): [base provider](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-panos/blob/master/lib/puppet/provider/panos_provider.rb), [type](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-panos/blob/master/lib/puppet/type/panos_address.rb), [actual provider with validation and xml processing](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-panos/blob/master/lib/puppet/provider/panos_address/panos_address.rb), and [new unit tests](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-panos/blob/master/spec/unit/puppet/provider/panos_provider_spec.rb) for 100% coverage.

## Deployment

The `puppet-resource_api` gem is part of the [Puppet 6 Platform](https://puppet.com/blog/introducing-puppet-6). With older versions of Puppet, you can use the [puppetlabs-resource_api module](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/resource_api) to install the gem on your servers and agents.

## Getting Started

1. Download the [Puppet Development Kit](https://puppet.com/download-puppet-development-kit) (PDK) appropriate to your operating system and architecture.

2. Create a [new module](https://puppet.com/docs/pdk/latest/pdk_generating_modules.html) with the PDK, or work with an existing PDK-enabled module. To create a new module, run `pdk new module <MODULE_NAME>` from the command line, specifying the name of the module. Respond to the dialog questions.

3. To add the `puppet-resource_api` gem and enable "modern" rspec-style mocking, open the `.sync.yml` file in your editor, and add the following content:

```
# .sync.yml
---
Gemfile:
  optional:
    ':development':
      - gem: 'puppet-resource_api'
spec/spec_helper.rb:
  mock_with: ':rspec'
```

4. Apply these changes by running `pdk update`

You will get the following response:

```
$ pdk update
pdk (INFO): Updating david-example using the default template, from 1.4.1 to 1.4.1

----------Files to be modified----------
Gemfile
spec/spec_helper.rb

----------------------------------------

You can find a report of differences in update_report.txt.

Do you want to continue and make these changes to your module? Yes

------------Update completed------------

2 files modified.

$
```

5. Create the required files for a new type and provider in the module by running `pdk new provider <provider_name>`

You will get the following response:

```
$ pdk new provider foo
pdk (INFO): Creating '.../example/lib/puppet/type/foo.rb' from template.
pdk (INFO): Creating '.../example/lib/puppet/provider/foo/foo.rb' from template.
pdk (INFO): Creating '.../example/spec/unit/puppet/provider/foo/foo_spec.rb' from template.
pdk (INFO): Creating '.../example/spec/unit/puppet/type/foo_spec.rb' from template.
$
```

The four generated files are the type, the implementation, and the unit tests. The default template contains an example that demonstrates the basic workings of the Resource API. This allows the unit tests to run immediately after creating the provider, which will look like this:

```
$ pdk test unit
[✔] Preparing to run the unit tests.
[✔] Running unit tests.
  Evaluated 5 tests in 0.012065973 seconds: 0 failures, 0 pending.
[✔] Cleaning up after running unit tests.
$
```

### Writing the Type

The type contains the shape of your resources. The template provides the necessary `name` and `ensure` attributes. You can modify their description and the name's type to match your resource. Add more attributes as you need.

```ruby
# lib/puppet/type/foo.rb
require 'puppet/resource_api'

Puppet::ResourceApi.register_type(
  name: 'foo',
  docs: <<-EOS,
      This type provides Puppet with the capabilities to manage ...
    EOS
  attributes: {
    ensure: {
      type:    'Enum[present, absent]',
      desc:    'Whether this apt key should be present or absent on the target system.',
      default: 'present',
    },
    name: {
      type:      'String',
      desc:      'The name of the resource you want to manage.',
      behaviour: :namevar,
    },
  },
)
```

The following keys are available for defining attributes:
* `type`: the Puppet 4 data type allowed in this attribute. You can use all [data types](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_data_abstract.html#parent-types) matching `Scalar` and `Data`.
* `desc`: a string describing this attribute. This is used in creating the automated API docs with [puppet-strings](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-strings).
* `default`: a default value used by the runtime environment; when the caller does not specify a value for this attribute.
* `behaviour`/`behavior`: how the attribute behaves. The current available values include:
  * `namevar`: marks an attribute as part of the "primary key" or "identity" of the resource. A given set of `namevar` values needs to distinctively identify an instance.
  * `init_only`: this attribute can only be set during the creation of the resource. Its value will be reported going forward, but trying to change it later leads to an error. For example, the base image for a VM or the UID of a user.
  * `read_only`: values for this attribute will be returned by `get()`, but `set()` is not able to change them. Values for this should never be specified in a manifest. For example, the checksum of a file, or the MAC address of a network interface.
  * `parameter`: these attributes influence how the provider behaves, and cannot be read from the target system. For example, the target file on inifile, or the credentials to access an API.

### Writing the Provider

The provider is the most important part of your new resource, as it reads and enforces state. Here is the example generated by `pdk new provider`:

```ruby
require 'puppet/resource_api'
require 'puppet/resource_api/simple_provider'

# Implementation for the foo type using the Resource API.
class Puppet::Provider::Foo::Foo < Puppet::ResourceApi::SimpleProvider
  def get(_context)
    [
      {
        name: 'foo',
        ensure: 'present',
      },
      {
        name: 'bar',
        ensure: 'present',
      },
    ]
  end

  def create(context, name, should)
    context.notice("Creating '#{name}' with #{should.inspect}")
  end

  def update(context, name, should)
    context.notice("Updating '#{name}' with #{should.inspect}")
  end

  def delete(context, name)
    context.notice("Deleting '#{name}'")
  end
end
```

The optional `initialize` method can be used to set up state that is available throughout the execution of the catalog. This is most often used for establishing a connection, when talking to a service (e.g. when managing a database).

The `get(context)` method returns a list of hashes describing the resources that are currently on the target system. The basic example would always return an empty list. Here is an example of resources that could be returned from this:

```ruby
[
  {
    name: 'a',
    ensure: 'present',
  },
  {
    name: 'b',
    ensure: 'present',
  },
]
```

The `create`/`update`/`delete` methods get called by the `SimpleProvider` base-class to change the system as requested by the catalog. The `name` argument is the name of the resource that is being processed. `should` contains the attribute hash - in the same format as `get` returns - with the values in the catalog.

### Unit testing

The generated unit tests in `spec/unit/puppet/provider/foo_spec.rb` get automatically evaluated with `pdk test unit`.

### `puppet device` support

To support remote resources using `puppet device`, a few more steps are needed. First a `Puppet::Util::NetworkDevice::<device type>::Device` class needs to exist, which provides facts and connection management . That device class can inherit from `Puppet::Util::NetworkDevice::Simple::Device` to receive a simple default configuration parser using hocon.

The provider needs to specify the `remote_resource` feature to enable the second part of the machinery.

After this, `puppet device` will be able to use the new provider, and supply it (through the device class) with the URL specified in the [`device.conf`](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.3/config_file_device.html).

### Further Reading

The [Resource API](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-specifications/blob/master/language/resource-api/README.md) describes details of all the capabilities of this gem.

The [hue_rsapi module](https://github.com/da-ar/hue_rsapi) is a very simple example for using the Resource API for remote resources.

The [meraki module](https://github.com/meraki/puppet-module) is a full example for using the Resource API for remote resources.

This [Introduction to Testing Puppet Modules](https://www.netways.de/index.php?id=3445#c44135) talk describes rspec usage in more detail.

The [RSpec docs](https://relishapp.com/rspec) provide an overview of the capabilities of rspec.

## Known Issues

This gem is still under heavy development. This section is a living document of what is already done, and what items are still outstanding.

Currently working:
* Basic type and provider definition, using `name`, `desc`, and `attributes`.
* Scalar puppet 4 [data types](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.3/lang_data_type.html#core-data-types):
  * String, Enum, Pattern
  * Integer, Float, Numeric
  * Boolean
  * Array
  * Optional
  * Variant
* The `canonicalize`, `simple_get_filter`, and `remote_resource` features.
* All the logging facilities.
* Executing the new provider under the following commands:
  * `puppet apply`
  * `puppet resource`
  * `puppet agent`
  * `puppet device` (if applicable)

There are still a few notable gaps between the implementation and the specification:
* Complex data types, like Hash, Tuple or Struct are not yet implemented.
* Only a single runtime environment (the Puppet commands) is currently implemented.

Restrictions of puppet:
* `supports_noop` is not effective, as puppet doesn't call into the type under noop at all.
* Attributes cannot be called `title`, `provider`, or any of the [metaparameters](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.5/metaparameter.html), as those are reserved by puppet itself.

Future possibilities:
* [Multiple Providers](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDK-530)
* [Commands API](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDK-847)
