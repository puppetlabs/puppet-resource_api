# Protocol::HTTP

Provides abstractions for working with the HTTP protocol.

[![Development Status](https://github.com/socketry/protocol-http/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/socketry/protocol-http/actions?workflow=Test)

## Features

  - General abstractions for HTTP requests and responses.
  - Symmetrical interfaces for client and server.
  - Light-weight middleware model for building applications.

## Usage

Please see the [project documentation](https://socketry.github.io/protocol-http/) for more details.

  - [Streaming](https://socketry.github.io/protocol-http/guides/streaming/index) - This guide gives an overview of how to implement streaming requests and responses.

  - [Getting Started](https://socketry.github.io/protocol-http/guides/getting-started/index) - This guide explains how to use `protocol-http` for building abstract HTTP interfaces.

  - [Design Overview](https://socketry.github.io/protocol-http/guides/design-overview/index) - This guide explains the high level design of `protocol-http` in the context of wider design patterns that can be used to implement HTTP clients and servers.

## Releases
